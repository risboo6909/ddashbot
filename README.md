This is a simple bot for Facebook Diamond Dash game from Wooga. The code itself is awful and was written, literally in 11 hours
just for fun without any special purpose just to beat me friend's record. Anyway it does what it have to do and my record in
that game so far is ~900k =) not bad, can't imagine to beat this score by myself, without bot )) It still does mistakes despite that
I tried to figure out delays for a long time (does someone know how to easily improve this???) so average score it gets is about 300k,
in case of lucky diamonds set it can easily get 600k-700k, 900k is actually something rare =)

Use timebonuses and bombs to improve results ;)
